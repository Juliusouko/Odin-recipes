# RECIPE-Project

This is my first Odin Project. I am getting familiarised with the basic structuring of HTML.
At the end of this project I should not only structure my content properly but also understand why
i used a certain element and tag and why I followed the syntax.

The skills that this projects test include:basic structuring of HTML elements and tags, absolute and relative paths
while providing links for pages.

If you're reading this, this stuff is easy just put your mind to it and you'll conquer it. Also don't forget that 
practice makes perfection pal. In web development and anything related to software engineeering.
